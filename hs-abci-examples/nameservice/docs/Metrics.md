# Metrics

The SDK has some build in support for metrics via [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), but ultimately you may choose a different runtime interpretation for the metrics, or even choose to ignore it entirely. The nameservice application docker network is configured to run a prometheus metrics server and a datadog agent to scrape metrics and push to datadog. You must supply a datadog api key as an environment variable *DD_API_KEY* when you launch the network if you want to do do this.

The Nameservice application uses application specific metrics, for instance increasing the message counters for module level messages, or for timing module responses. It also uses the server metrics via the [metrics middleware](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/hs-abci/blob/master/hs-abci-extra/src/Network/ABCI/Server/Middleware/Metrics.hs) to count abci messages and time server responses. This middleware is highly recommended in any production system.
