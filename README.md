[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/f-o-a-m/kepler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/f-o-a-m/kepler)

## Introduction
This is the official repository for the Haskell implementation of the ABCI server and
SDK for developing applications backed by the Tendermint replication engine. You can
read more about Tendermint and the ABCI specs in their [documentation](https://tendermint.com/docs/spec/abci/).

To understand how to build a simple application using this library, see the literate haskell [walkthrough](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/kepler/blob/master/hs-abci-docs/nameservice/README.md).
