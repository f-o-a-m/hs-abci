# hs-abci

![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.com/f-o-a-m/hs-abci.svg?branch=master)

## Introduction
This is the official repository for the Haskell implementation of the ABCI server and
SDK for developing applications backed by the Tendermint replication engine. You can
read more about Tendermint and the ABCI specs in their [documentation](https://tendermint.com/docs/spec/abci/).

## Build

### Prerequisites

#### stack
At the moment the project's build is managed by `stack`. You can find everything you need regarding how to install stack on your machine [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

#### protoc
We use a custom setup to generate Haskell bindings to the protobuf files, using the proto-lens library from Google. In order for this to work you need to have the protobuf compiler `protoc` on your machine. You can get installation instructions [here](https://google.github.io/proto-lens/installing-protoc.html)

#### style
You will also need to install `hlint` and `stylish-haskell` for code hygiene during development. In the project root simply run

```bash
> stack install hlint stylish-haskell
```

### Commands
There is a `Makefile` for this project where you can find all of the options for building, testing etc. The `Makefile`
is documented and there is a help menu which you can access via the commands `make` or `make help`.

## Protobuf Files and Generated Modules
The protobuf files are all in the `/protos` directory, and we use a custom setup in order
to generate the corresponding `Proto.*` Haskell modules. If you want to view all of these
generated modules, you can run

```bash
> cd hs-abci-server && find .stack-work -path '*autogen/Proto'
```

to find the root directory.

## Style Guide
There is a `.stylish-haskell.yaml` file that controls some of the style guide, particularly
around import statements and some indentation rules. There is also a small guide for things that
fall outside of this in the [style wiki](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/hs-abci/wiki/code-style-guide).
If it's not covered by either of these but you think it's really important, mention it in an issue.

## Building documentation
You can build the haddocks for the library code only using

```bash
make build-docs-local
```

This does not build and link documentation for dependencies, useful mostly for testing
documentation formatting.
